#  Describes all 8 features and how to verify that they were implemented
## Feature 1: Login Page

The user enters email and password. The database will verify and login the user in if only it's a valid user.

## Feature 2: Register Org Page

Once you click on the button, it will take you to a register page. The register page registers an organization. It prompts the user to input company info and new manager's info. To verify it, open the database and see if the data is added to the database. 

## Feature 3: Logout Page

The user has to be logged in to be logged out. The page should be redirected to login page if a user is logged out successfully.

## Feature 4: Database (Login info)

There are two tables. One is for employee and the other is for organization. To verify, drop the file to the link and it will display the structure of the database.
